                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Hi I’m Jaime, I’m a self taught baker with hopes to inspire others to try new recipes and gain confidence in their ability to bake. Most of my experience came from watching my mother put together meals, and desserts for the family.</p>

                    <p>My love for baking really started my first year of college when I decided to fill my free time with trying new bakes. I didn’t have all the tools and gadgets that most bakers have, so I had to be creative and innovative with how I approached certain recipes. This helped me learn lots of tricks and new skills that I hope to share with you.<p></p>
                        
                    <p>Baking is such a big part of my life and it brings me lots of joy. I hope that you are able to see that joy in what I post and are also able to feel that joy for yourself.</p>
